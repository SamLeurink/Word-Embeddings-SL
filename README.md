Welcome to the repository for the code which I used to create the sentiment lexicon. To achieve the results I have achieved there are a few steps you need to take.

1. First of all you need to download the NRC-VAD lexicon. This can be done on this website: https://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/nrc-vad.html. 
2. You need to run the python code Download_models. This requires you to have the text file of the NRC-VAD. Difficulties can occur when you don't have the text file in the map you're currently working in. If this happens you need to switch out the document name for the file path. 
3. At last you should run the R code Creating_results. This code will give you the final results along with some usefull graphs.
